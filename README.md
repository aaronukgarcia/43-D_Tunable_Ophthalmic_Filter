# 43-D: Ambient-Adaptive Tunable Ophthalmic Filters for CVD and Photophobia

> **Part of [Project 43 — Labrador](https://github.com/aaronukgarcia): Exploring commercial and scientific applications of synthetic labradorescence**

## Overview

Proposes a dynamically tunable spectral filter in an ophthalmic form factor for colour vision deficiency (CVD) correction and photophobia management. Unlike existing fixed-notch products (EnChroma, Pilestone, Avulux), the device would adapt its filtering profile to the individual and lighting conditions.

## Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Stage | Medical Device |
| Spectral optimisation algorithm | **Does not exist** |
| Prototype | None |
| Seeking | LC photonic crystals, colorimetry, ophthalmic device design, clinical validation |

## Key Idea

A liquid crystal photonic crystal tuneable notch filter with ambient light sensing and a spectral optimisation algorithm could provide personalised, real-time colour correction. The 40% transmittance floor of current LC technology is a hard physics constraint. Overcoming or working within this limitation is central to the feasibility of any practical device.

## Target Applications (Conditional)

- CVD correction
- Photophobia / migraine management
